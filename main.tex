\section{Questions}
\textbf{Q1: Explicitly describe image convolution: the input, the transformation, and the output.
Why is it useful for computer vision?} 

Image convolution uses a kernel that is applied to each pixel in the image to create a new image.
A kernel is used to view neighboring cells in the image and calculate a new pixel value for the 
resulting image.

\textbf{Q2: What is the difference between convolution and correlation? Construct a scenario that
produces a different output between both operations and show some images of the result.
(you can use built in correlation functions and convolution functions in scipy here if
desired).}  

Convolution takes two images and produces a new third image. Convolution is also a mathematical
operation that takes to functions and creates a third function.
Correlation measures the displacement of one signal relative to the other signal. It measures 
similarity of two images.
Correlation is similar to convolution.  

\textbf{Q3: What is the difference between a high pass filter and a low pass filter in how they
are constructed and what they do to the image? Please provide example kernels and output
images.} 

The main difference between the two filters is the range of frequency that they allow to pass through them.
A high pass filter passes signals with frequencies that are above a certain threshold.
A low pass filter passes signals with frequencies that are below a certain threshold.
Low pass filters can be created by taking an images and removing or subtracting the 
high-pass signals from it.
